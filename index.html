		<p>In the morning today, we studied Linux. Our main topic was the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. We looked at numerous directories in the Linux system, such as the bin, boot, etc, mnt, media, proc, var, srv directories. Then we learned how to do symbolic links. At that point we broke for lunch.</p>
		<p>After lunch team from Webhead came to visit Tech Talent South. The DevOps class was in attendance at their talk.</p>

		<p>After the talk, the DevOps class gathered together in the classroom and continued our study of html and css. We created this blog.</p>

		<h3>Friday, May 4th, 2018</h3>
		<p>We have been having consistent problems with installing Linux virtual machines in Virtual Box for Windows 10. The problem is that Virtual Box for Windows 10 does not seem to allow 64-bit versions of Linux to be installed; but 64-bit versions are all that are available at this point.</p>
		<p>On a Mac, when we install Virtual Box, we then download, say, an Ubuntu disk image. We click on "New" on the Virtual Box menu, and we are taken through an install sequence. At the end, we see the VM we created, with a legend such as "powered off."</p>
		<img src="images/VbScreenShot1.jpg" alt="Screen shot of Virtual Box">
		<p> When we double-click on the machine for the first time, it takes us to another interactive menu, where we have a drop-down list of machine types we can choose from. By default, in Windows 10, no 64-bit options are available, whereas by default in Mac OSX, many 64-bit options are available. We want to make it so that the Windows systems have the same options as the Mac systems.</p>

		<p>The issue has been arising in HP machines. On a Microsoft Surface machine we did not experience the same problem.</p>
		<p>The first step towards resolving the problem on HP machines with Windows 10, was booting to BIOS. On HP machines, this is accomplished by restarting the machine, then repeatedly jabbing F9 until you see some text saying that it is going to enter BIOS mode. It may have another name for that, like Setup Utility. When you do boot to BIOS, it will look like this (except the instructor and student reflections will be different).</p>
		<img src="images/IMG_1690-800.jpg" alt="Screen shot of booting to BIOS on an HP machine">
		<p>Notice the menu across the top, with the options Main, Security, System Configuration, and Exit. You move between these with the direction arrows. Go right with the direction arrows until you are in System Configuration. Notice the Virtualization Technology is disabled by default</p>
		<img src="images/IMG_1693-800.jpg" alt="The system configuration screen in HP BIOS">
		<p>You should see a menu across the bottom indicating what keys to use. The current HP BIOS has F5 or F6 to change setting, so use F5 or F6 to change Virtualization Technology to Enabled.</p>

		<img src="images/IMG_1695-800.jpg" alt="The system configuration instructions in HP BIOS">
		<p>Use F10 to save and exit. The computer will restart, and you will now have the 64-bit options in Virtual Box.</p>

		<p>My name is Avery Smith, I am a UTSA satistics major with a minor in actuarail science. Even though a STEM degree is a great degree to have, I've realized as Im aproaching the end of my college career that I am not completly satisfied. I asked my self what do I really want to do with the rest of my life, and I can finally say computer coding is the answer. I have always had an interest in computer coding but did nothing about it till I got so far into my STATS degree, changing it to computer science discouraged me. I was determined to figure something out if it was possible to get a quality education in computer coding outside of college and thats when I discovered tech talent south.</p>
		<p>Tech Talent South is an amazing coding school. It's a very hands on project based learning school witch is great, Im creating full scale web applications from the ground up. Im taking the devops course learning linux, ruby on rails, html, css, java, git hub, docker, and much more while also learning how each program is essential for the other. DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development and software operation. Because of this new practice I am able to cut development and operations time in half and continuosly deploy apps to keep companys apps up to date with the lastest products in thier respective fields.</p>
		<p>It makes me happy that not only do I now get to have a career that won't bore me to death, I also get to give back to my family. My family owns a small buisness called Nogalitos Gear Companey, they bought it in the year 2001 and have done a tramendous job. they are currently the number one buisness against thier competitors, have doubled in size, and are now ready for a full ecomerce website. Having a full ecomerce website custom built is very expensive. Now i have the skills necesarry to build the ecomerce website of thier dreams for free and I couldn't be happier doing it.</p>
