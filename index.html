		<h3>Thursday, May 3rd, 2018</h3>
		<p>In the morning today, we studied Linux. Our main topic was the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. We looked at numerous directories in the Linux system, such as the bin, boot, etc, mnt, media, proc, var, srv directories. Then we learned how to do symbolic links. At that point we broke for lunch.</p>
		<p>After lunch team from Webhead came to visit Tech Talent South. The DevOps class was in attendance at their talk.</p>
