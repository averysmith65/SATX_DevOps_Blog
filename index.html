		<p>In the morning today, we studied Linux. Our main topic was the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. We looked at numerous directories in the Linux system, such as the bin, boot, etc, mnt, media, proc, var, srv directories. Then we learned how to do symbolic links. At that point we broke for lunch.</p>
		<p>After lunch team from Webhead came to visit Tech Talent South. The DevOps class was in attendance at their talk.</p>

		<p>After the talk, the DevOps class gathered together in the classroom and continued our study of html and css. We created this blog.</p>

		<h3>Friday, May 4th, 2018</h3>
		<p>We have been having consistent problems with installing Linux virtual machines in Virtual Box for Windows 10. The problem is that Virtual Box for Windows 10 does not seem to allow 64-bit versions of Linux to be installed; but 64-bit versions are all that are available at this point.</p>
		<p>On a Mac, when we install Virtual Box, we then download, say, an Ubuntu disk image. We click on "New" on the Virtual Box menu, and we are taken through an install sequence. At the end, we see the VM we created, with a legend such as "powered off."</p>

		<p> When we double-click on the machine for the first time, it takes us to another interactive menu, where we have a drop-down list of machine types we can choose from. By default, in Windows 10, no 64-bit options are available, whereas by default in Mac OSX, many 64-bit options are available. We want to make it so that the Windows systems have the same options as the Mac systems.</p>
