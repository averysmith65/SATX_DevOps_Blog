        <p>In the morning today, we studied Linux. Our main topic was the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. We looked at numerous directories in the Linux system, such as the bin, boot, etc, mnt, media, proc, var, srv directories. Then we learned how to do symbolic links. At that point we broke for lunch.</p>
        <p>After lunch team from Webhead came to visit Tech Talent South. The DevOps class was in attendance at their talk.</p>

        <p>After the talk, the DevOps class gathered together in the classroom and continued our study of html and css. We created this blog.</p>

        <p>We have been having consistent problems with installing Linux virtual machines in Virtual Box for Windows 10. The problem is that Virtual Box for Windows 10 does not seem to allow 64-bit versions of Linux to be installed; but 64-bit versions are all that are available at this point.</p>
        <p>On a Mac, when we install Virtual Box, we then download, say, an Ubuntu disk image. We click on "New" on the Virtual Box menu, and we are taken through an install sequence. At the end, we see the VM we created, with a legend such as "powered off."</p>
        <img src="images/VbScreenShot1.jpg" alt="Screen shot of Virtual Box">
        <p> When we double-click on the machine for the first time, it takes us to another interactive menu, where we have a drop-down list of machine types we can choose from. By default, in Windows 10, no 64-bit options are available, whereas by default in Mac OSX, many 64-bit options are available. We want to make it so that the Windows systems have the same options as the Mac systems.</p>
        <img src="images/VbScreenShot2-800.jpg" alt="Screen shot of Virtual Box options for Linux system installs">
        <p>The issue has been arising in HP machines. On a Microsoft Surface machine we did not experience the same problem.</p>
        <p>The first step towards resolving the problem on HP machines with Windows 10, was booting to BIOS. On HP machines, this is accomplished by restarting the machine, then repeatedly jabbing F9 until you see some text saying that it is going to enter BIOS mode. It may have another name for that, like Setup Utility. When you do boot to BIOS, it will look like this (except the instructor and student reflections will be different).</p>
        <img src="images/IMG_1690-800.jpg" alt="Screen shot of booting to BIOS on an HP machine">
        <p>Notice the menu across the top, with the options Main, Security, System Configuration, and Exit. You move between these with the direction arrows. Go right with the direction arrows until you are in System Configuration. Notice the Virtualization Technology is disabled by default</p>
        <img src="images/IMG_1693-800.jpg" alt="The system configuration screen in HP BIOS">
        <p>You should see a menu across the bottom indicating what keys to use. The current HP BIOS has F5 or F6 to change setting, so use F5 or F6 to change Virtualization Technology to Enabled.</p>

        <img src="images/IMG_1695-800.jpg" alt="The system configuration instructions in HP BIOS">
        <p>Use F10 to save and exit. The computer will restart, and you will now have the 64-bit options in Virtual Box.</p>

        <h4>Zero to Hero (by Joshua Davidson)</h4>
        <p>BLAH BLAH, Ruby, SQL, HTML, BLAH BLAH, Jenkins, BLAH, GitHub, Rails, B BLAH BLAH, I love it all! As a closet computer lover I never stepped into the spotlight of computing besides an intro to programming course and a tutor role for CS students in discrete math and analysis of algorithms. ENTER TECH TALENT SOUTH (TTS). The DevOps program at TTS starts an adventure into front end to back end programming with a DevOps approach along the way (using Command Lines as a trusty sidekick).
            <br>I am astonished at the eloquent confluence of programming tools and languages. This is only week 4 and I'm already working on a Ubuntu virtual machine, developing a website via MDBootstrap, utlizing GitHub to collaborate on the project, and implementing Rails commands with a PostgreSQL database while modifying the embedded Ruby code to accomplish unique tasks. Personal I find this to be a near ZERO to HERO transformation (and there are 8 weeks to go!)
